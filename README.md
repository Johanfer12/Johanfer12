# About Me #

I am a developer with experience in various technologies and frameworks. Here are some repositories that showcase my skills:

- **[JohanferDash](https://github.com/johanfer12/JohanferDash)** : Work on a dashboard project using the Dash framework. I have experience in creating interactive and responsive web applications using Dash.

- **[Ask your Docs](https://github.com/johanfer12/django-ask-gpt)** : This Django model enhances your document interaction and search by integrating OpenAI's text embedding and GPT-3.5-turbo chat completion models. It simplifies querying a collection of precomputed text embeddings and generating responses using GPT-3.5-turbo.

- **[Weather_View](https://github.com/johanfer12/Weather_View)** : In this project, you'll find some of my code for building Shiny R applications. I have expertise in developing data-driven web applications using Shiny, along with libraries like ggplot2, dplyr, and plotly. (In Development)

- **[johanfer12.github.io](https://github.com/johanfer12/johanfer12.github.io)** : This repo contains my personal portfolio [website](https://johanfer12.github.io). I have built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on creating simple, intuitive, and responsive user interfaces that provide a great user experience.

- **[Buscatrabajo](https://github.com/johanfer12/Buscatrabajo)** : This code imports necessary modules for web scraping and automation using Selenium and ChromeDriverManager, and also imports modules for text manipulation and web browsing. It can be used to automate web tasks and scrape data from websites.
  
I am passionate about coding and always strive to learn and explore new technologies.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
